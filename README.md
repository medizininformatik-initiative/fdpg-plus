# fdpg-plus

This repository is used to:
- collect issues spanning multiple repositories
- collect issues from the community


## Community Issues

To create a coherent overview of all issues and how they relate to the release planning we ask the community to mostly use this repository to submit new issues,
unless the person adding the issues is certain which repository the issues belongs to. In this case the person should create the issue directly in the appropriate repository.

### Submitting an Issues

**1. Please ensure that any issue is described a clearly as possible.**

**2. When a new issues is submitted we will it will first have to be reviewed by one of our project managers.**

**3. We will check the issue and give you feedback or ask additional questions.**

**4.  On Issue acceptance: Creating sub issues or moving issue to appropriate repository**
 - If your issue is accepted and spans multiple repositories we will keep the issue in this repository, create the appropriate sub issues in the respective repositories and update the progress of this issue as it goes throuh our system
 - If your issues is accepted and is particular to one repository we will create an issue in this repository, link this new issue from your created issue and close the issue here.

**5. Issue low priority or out of scope**
- some issues might be considered within scope but very low priority due to resource constraints, which we would let you know via comment in your issue. In this case you have the option to fork the repository(ies) and implement the feature yourself. We would ask you to let us know if your are planning to implement a feature yourself as we might consider merging it in the main repositories.
- Some issues might be considered out of scope. These issues are issues we would not merge into the main repositories, however you have the option of maintaining a fork of the appropriate repository(ies) with your changes.
